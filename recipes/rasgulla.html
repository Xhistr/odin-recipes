    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>If you are intimidated by the idea of making rasgullas at home, please do not be any longer. I was too, until one day I tried it and realized I was worried for no reason all these years. They are quite easy and super quick to make. Give these a try.</p>
    </br>


    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>6 cups milk</i></li>
        <li><i>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</i></li>
        <li><i>2Â½ cups white sugar</i></li>
        <li><i>6 cups water</i></li>
        <li><i>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</i></li>
    </ul>
    </br>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming; immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You should see the milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth; rinse the chenna with cold water to get rid of the lime juice. Allow the water to drain completely.</i></li>
        </br>
        <li><i>Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as possible; what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a rolling mat or other smooth surface. Knead the paneer well to make a smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions.</i></li>
        </br>
        <li><i>Bring the water to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the boiling water until dissolved.</i></li>
        </br>
        <li><i>Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms, making sure there are no cracks; gently drop the balls into the hot syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure. Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes.</i></li>
        </br>
        <li><i>Release the pressure from the cooker while running under water; remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded 2 or 3 times in size. Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely before serving cold.</i></li>
    </ol>
